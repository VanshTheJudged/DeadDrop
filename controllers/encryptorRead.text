In cryptography, a CIPHER is like 
a lock that you use to encrypt (lock) and decrypt (unlock) data.

const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(...)
you are creating a cipher object using Node.js's crypto module.
This object is what does the actual encryption.

1. What is Buffer?
ðŸ“˜ Simple Meaning:
A Buffer in Node.js is a way to handle binary data â€” data thatâ€™s not just plain text.

Normally, strings are human-readable.

But encryption/decryption works with binary, not normal strings.

So we use Buffer to convert between string and binary.

here when we use Buffer.from(key,hex); we are converting key to hex;
hex = hexadecimal.

2.What is "utf8" in cipher.update()?
You saw this line:

let encrypted = cipher.update(text, "utf8", "hex");
This function has 3 arguments:

cipher.update(plaintext, inputEncoding, outputEncoding);
So in your case:

text: the normal message (e.g., "Hello Vansh")

"utf8": how you are giving the input to the cipher

"hex": how you want the encrypted output

âœ… What is "utf8"?
"utf8" (or UTF-8) is a standard encoding for text â€” it tells the computer:

"This text is made of readable characters like A, B, C, â‚¬, ðŸ˜‚, etc."

Almost all modern text uses "utf8".

:

3.cipher.final("hex")
This line:
encrypted += cipher.final("hex");
is super important in encryption.

ðŸ§  What's happening here?
When you encrypt using a cipher, the encryption doesnâ€™t happen all at once.

cipher.update(...) encrypts most of the data.

But the last few bytes (or leftover data) stay buffered inside the cipher.

So to finish encryption, you MUST call:

cipher.final(outputEncoding)
